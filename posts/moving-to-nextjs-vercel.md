I have been tinkering around with a lot of Frontend frameworks recently, and the best way to learn them is to build/rebuild your own blog. 

As a part of that process, this website is now powered by NextJS and is running on Vercel. The combo does a lot of heavy lifting wrt performance and best practices. I don't want to be the one keep track and enforcing best practices.
