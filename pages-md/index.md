## About

I am a seasoned technical product manager who has shipped products for developers in advertising, gaming, marketing, analytics, and software supply chain. I have worked on SDKs, developer dashboards, and internal developer tools.

I am an entrepreneur at heart. As a perpetual learner, my career has taken me from being an Android developer to attempting to build various products and startups. Along the way, I have worked in mobile advertising, podcasting, media & marketing automation, mobile games, data analytics, and mobile game publishing. Currently, I am the Lead Product Manager for the Compute Platform at Lowe's.  India. I have built a Google Sheets Plugin as a side project [StitchIQ](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/stitchiq/931004878305), and have also built software for close friends.
